### Introduction and instructions: 
####    Bert is a Tensorflow-api for natural language processing. My instructions on installing dependnecies are on the script called "BertClient with tf.data API" on (lines 3-6). The  only error happens at the end where I have marked it as question is #6. It is the only major question I have on the script (see below).


### Major question: 
####    Question #6-- why am I getting the "invalid argument error" at the end, and how can I solve it? (You may download the data file  "rows.json" and the Bert api "uncased. L-12..." from above and run it code on "BertClient with tf.data API".)


### Minor questions:
####    2,4 & 5 relate to machine learning; 1 & 3  are python related.
