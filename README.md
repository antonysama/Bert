### Purpose: 
####    First, make a tf.data api for Bert in order to make on-the-fly word embeddings. Bert is a Tensorflow-api for natural language processing (the original tutorial s reference #1 below). Second, attempt the same goal in keras (reference#2)

### Instructions:
####    You may download the data file  "rows.json" and the Bert api "uncased. L-12..." from above. Instructions to installing and running are on the script  "BertClient with tf.data API" . 

### Major questions: 
####    First, the  only  error happens at the end of the script. I have marked it as question is #6: why am I getting the "invalid argument error"? Second, I would like to attempt the same goal in keras (reference#2)
