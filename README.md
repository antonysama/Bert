### Introduction: 
#### Bert is an Tensorflow-api for natural language processing. I'm working on the file "BertClient with tf.data API." If you're unfamiliar with Bert, see the instructions on installing dependnecies (lines 3-6) on that file (above.) My questions are that file, too. Major question is #6


### Major question: 
####  Question #6-- why am I getting the "invalid argument error" at the end, and how can I solve it? (You may download the data file  "rows.json" and the Bert api "uncased. L-12..." from above and run it code on "BertClient with tf.data API".)


### Minor questions:
#### 2,4 & 5 relate to machine learning; 1 & 3  are python related.
